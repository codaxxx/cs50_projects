This program is designed to determine which word has more value in a game of Scrabble.

By creating this program, I gained an in-depth understanding of arrays, strings, string.h, and ctype.h.

This program was evaluated to the following scenarios:

$ ./scrabble
Player 1: Question?
Player 2: Question!
Tie!

$ ./scrabble
Player 1: red
Player 2: wheelbarrow
Player 2 wins!

$ ./scrabble
Player 1: COMPUTER
Player 2: science
Player 1 wins!

$ ./scrabble
Player 1: Scrabble
Player 2: wiNNeR
Player 1 wins!
